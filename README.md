## The Challenge
Chasing the Clicks is the first level of five within the competition. Participants were tasked with:
    * creating a hosted web app
    * with a clickable button and click count
    * everytime the button is clicked, the count increases by one
    * when the web app is refreshed, the click count number should reflect previous clicks
